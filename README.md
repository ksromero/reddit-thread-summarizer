# Reddit Thread Summarizer

A Reddit thread summarizer is a tool that generates a summary of the main points or 
themes discussed in a Reddit thread (a discussion forum on the website Reddit). 
The summarizer may also provide information about the overall sentiment expressed in 
the thread **(including the users comment)**. 
This can be useful for quickly getting a sense of the main points of discussion in a long 
or complex thread, or for identifying trends or common opinions among Reddit users.

            for multiple seasons and is still popular with viewers. It is a light,
