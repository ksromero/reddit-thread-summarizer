# Reddit Thread Summarizer

A Reddit thread summarizer is a tool that generates a summary of the main points or 
themes discussed in a Reddit thread (a discussion forum on the website Reddit). 
The summarizer may also provide information about the overall sentiment expressed in 
the thread (including users comment). 
This can be useful for quickly getting a sense of the main points of discussion in a long 
or complex thread, or for identifying trends or common opinions among Reddit users.

            lack of realism, with some noting that the characters' fashion choices are unrealistic. 
            Additionally, some people find the show's cultural imperialism and ignorance to be
            problematic. There is also discussion about the DJ's race and the bechdel test, 
            as well as whether race or gender should be relevant to the show.

            was canceled before they had a chance to finish it, as it had a lot of unanswered 
            questions and potential for a second season. Despite this, some viewers have enjoyed
            shows like Dark and Mr Robot, and have expressed their disappointment when they were
